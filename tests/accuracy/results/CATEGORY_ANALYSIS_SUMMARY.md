## Conclusion

This multi-category evaluation reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the fact verification system across different claim types. The results can be used to:

1. **Prioritize Development**: Focus on improving low-performing categories
2. **Guide Data Collection**: Collect more training data for weak categories
3. **Inform Architecture**: Consider category-specific models or ensemble approaches
4. **Monitor Quality**: Track category performance over time to detect regressions

## Next Steps

1. Implement recommendations for low-performing categories
2. Collect additional training data for underrepresented categories
3. Consider fine-tuning models per category
4. Re-evaluate after implementation to measure improvements
5. Continue monitoring category performance as system evolves
