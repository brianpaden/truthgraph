"""ML Model Accuracy Validation Tests.

This module tests accuracy of ML components:
- NLI (Natural Language Inference) model
- Verdict aggregation logic
- Search relevance (precision@k, recall@k)
- Embedding quality metrics

Accuracy Targets:
- NLI accuracy: >85% on standard benchmarks
- Verdict aggregation: >90% correctness on synthetic data
- Search precision@5: >80%
- Search recall@10: >70%

Test Dataset:
- MNLI (Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference) for NLI
- Custom labeled verdict aggregation test cases
- Synthetic search relevance dataset
