## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Fact-Checker Verdict Consistency
**Issue**: Different fact-checkers use different verdict terminologies (TRUE/FALSE, CORRECT/INCORRECT, CLAIM TRUE/CLAIM FALSE)

**Solution**: Created comprehensive verdict mapping table documenting all transformations. Standardized all verdicts to SUPPORTED/REFUTED/INSUFFICIENT format.

**Example**:
- Snopes "TRUE" → SUPPORTED
- PolitiFact "PANTS_ON_FIRE" → REFUTED
- Reuters "CLAIM FALSE" → REFUTED

### Challenge 2: Evidence Extraction
**Issue**: Fact-checker articles are lengthy; extracting relevant evidence without verbatim copying

**Solution**: Summarized fact-checker reasoning into 1-3 sentence evidence items that:
- Capture the key factual content
- Avoid direct verbatim copying (copyright respect)
- Maintain semantic meaning
- Link back to original sources with URLs

### Challenge 3: Balanced Dataset Creation
**Issue**: Creating 20-30 real-world claims with proper distribution

**Solution**: Systematically selected claims from fact-checkers ensuring:
- Multiple verdict types (10 SUPPORTED, 12 REFUTED, 6 INSUFFICIENT)
- Multiple categories (6 different domains)
- Multiple sources (6 different fact-checkers)
- Mix of recent and historical claims
- Both simple and complex claims

### Challenge 4: Verdict Confidence Calculation
**Issue**: Some claims are clearer than others; need confidence scores

**Solution**: Assigned confidence based on:
- Strength of fact-checker certainty
- Amount of supporting evidence
- Historical consistency of the claim
- Peer-reviewed evidence availability

Range: 0.60 (INSUFFICIENT) to 0.99 (REFUTED - flat earth)

## Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Load Evidence into Vector Database
```python
# After implementing:
for evidence in real_world_evidence["evidence"]:
    embedding = embedding_service.embed_text(evidence["content"])
    vector_db.store(evidence_id, embedding, evidence)
```

### 2. Run Baseline Accuracy Test
Once database is populated:
```bash
pytest tests/accuracy/test_accuracy_baseline.py::test_baseline_accuracy -v
```

### 3. Establish Baseline Metrics
Document baseline accuracy and create comparison dashboard showing:
- Overall accuracy percentage
- Accuracy by category
- Accuracy by fact-checker source
- Confusion matrix analysis

### 4. Add More Claims
Future expansion plans:
- Add 50-100 additional claims (in 5.0+ phase)
- Include multilingual claims
- Add adversarial/edge cases
- Include temporal claims (expiring claims)

### 5. Implement Version Tracking
Set up automated comparison:
```bash
# Track accuracy across versions
pytest tests/accuracy/ --compare-baseline
```

### 6. Category-Specific Testing
Add minimum accuracy targets per category:
- Science claims: 75%+
- Health claims: 80%+
- History claims: 90%+
- Politics claims: 85%+
