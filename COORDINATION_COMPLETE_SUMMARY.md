## RISK MITIGATION PREPARED

### 5 Main Risks Identified & Mitigated

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Profiling overhead affects results | Medium | Medium | Use sampling, compare with/without |
| Results vary between runs | Medium | Low | Multiple iterations, report P50/P95 |
| Memory profiling adds complexity | Medium | Low | Optional detailed mode, lightweight tracking |
| Batch sizes too large cause OOM | Low | Medium | Incremental testing, exception handling |
| GPU/CPU results differ | High | Medium | Profile CPU (primary), note GPU separately |

**All risks have specific, documented mitigation strategies**
