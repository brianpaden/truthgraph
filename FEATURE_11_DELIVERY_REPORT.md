## Architecture & Design

### Multi-Stage Build Strategy

```
┌─ Stage 1: base ────────────────────────┐
│ Python 3.12 slim + system deps         │
│ (curl, gcc, g++, postgresql-client)   │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ (shared base)
    ┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Stage 2a: ml-stage       Stage 2b: core-stage
    │ Build-essentials    OR   (lighter)
    │ torch
    │ transformers
    │ sentence-transformers
    └────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ (via build arg)
    ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
    │ Stage 3: runtime                     │
    │ App code + configuration             │
    └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Model Cache Flow

2. API initializes
3. Models detected as missing
4. Models download from Hugging Face (~2-3 min)
5. Models saved to `.volumes/models`
6. Health check passes
7. Ready for requests

**Subsequent Starts**:
1. Container starts
2. API initializes
3. Models loaded from cache (< 1s)
4. Health check passes immediately
5. Ready for requests

### GPU Support Architecture

- Optional docker-compose override file
- NVIDIA Docker runtime configuration
- Device allocation (all GPUs or specific)
- Backward compatible with CPU mode
- CUDA environment setup
- Performance tuning documentation

- [ ] Execute docker-health-check.sh
- [ ] Test with actual model downloads
- [ ] Verify health checks pass
- [ ] Confirm model caching works
- [ ] Test on different hardware (CPU/GPU)

### Before Production

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Design
1. **Single model cache location** - Could support multiple cache paths
2. **Hardcoded models** - Could add environment variables for model selection
3. **No pre-built images** - Builds each time (could publish to registry)
4. **Root user in container** - Non-root user preparation exists but not active
5. **Manual GPU setup** - Could autodetect and auto-configure

### Potential Enhancements (Phase 3+)
1. Pre-built Docker images in registry
2. Kubernetes deployment manifests
3. Docker Swarm configurations
4. Multi-architecture builds (ARM support)
5. Container security scanning in CI/CD
6. Auto-scaling configurations
7. Load balancer configuration
8. Custom metric exports

| Memory constraints | 4GB limit documented, batch size tuning guide |
| GPU compatibility | Optional override, auto-detection, fallback to CPU |
| Build time too long | Multi-stage caching, build optimization |
| Model stale data | Cache management guide, update instructions |

### Operational Risks Addressed

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Secrets in code | .env file guidance, production examples |
| Volume data loss | Named volumes, backup strategy docs |
| Performance degradation | Health checks, monitoring guidance |
| Disk space | Cache cleanup procedures documented |
