## Common Questions

### "I just started, what's Phase 2 about?"

Phase 2 is the ML Core implementation of TruthGraph. We're 26% done with 7 of 27 features completed. The remaining work is split into 5 categories:

1. **Dataset & Testing** - Test data for validation
2. **Performance Optimization** - Speed and efficiency
3. **Validation Framework** - Accuracy measurement
4. **API Completion** - HTTP endpoints and integration
5. **Documentation** - Code docs, examples, guides

### "How long do I have?"

**Timeline**: ~2 weeks with 6 agents working in parallel
**Your Role Hours**: 30-70 hours depending on your role
**Critical Path**: ~110-120 sequential hours

### "What if I don't understand a feature?"

1. Read the feature details in your category handoff
2. Check [dependencies_and_timeline.md](./dependencies_and_timeline.md) for context
3. Review [completed_features_reference.md](./completed_features_reference.md) for similar features
4. Ask your coordinator or other agents

### "What are the success criteria?"

Main targets:
- Accuracy: >70% on test claims
- End-to-end latency: <60 seconds
- Embedding throughput: >500 texts/sec
- Memory: <4GB
- Code quality: 100% type hints, 80%+ test coverage, 0 lint errors

See [success_criteria_and_risks.md](./success_criteria_and_risks.md) for full list.

### "Where do I find completed work?"

See [completed_features_reference.md](./completed_features_reference.md) - features 1.1-1.6 have detailed summaries.

### "What if my work blocks someone else?"

Check [dependencies_and_timeline.md](./dependencies_and_timeline.md) to see who depends on you. Prioritize if others are blocked.
