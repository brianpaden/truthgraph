- [ ] Paste into new file
- [ ] Verify line count is approximately correct

**Step 3: Add category header**
For each file, add header (25-30 lines):
```markdown

# Phase 2 Handoff - Document Migration (2025-10-30)

The original `v0_phase2_completion_handoff.md` has been split into focused handoff documents.

## Why the split?
- Easier navigation for specialized agents
- Faster onboarding (agents read only relevant content)
- Clearer dependencies and responsibilities
- Better maintainability

## Where to start?
- [Master Index](v0_phase2_completion_handoff_MASTER.md)
- [Quick Start](v0_phase2_quick_start.md)
- [Agent Navigation Guide](AGENT_NAVIGATION_GUIDE.md)

## What happened to the original?
- Preserved for reference
- Content redistributed to split documents
- Can be deprecated after split verification
```

### Prepare Communication

Draft message to team:

Subject: Phase 2 Handoff Documents Reorganized
```
The Phase 2 handoff documents have been reorganized for better navigation.

WHAT CHANGED:
- Single 2290-line document → 12 focused documents
- Agent-specific files organized by category
- Cross-cutting files for timeline and dependencies
- Completed features archived in planning/features/completed/

WHERE TO START:
1. Read: planning/phases/phase_2/v0_phase2_quick_start.md (5 min)
2. Read: Your role-specific handoff file (1-2 hours)
3. Reference: planning/phases/phase_2/AGENT_NAVIGATION_GUIDE.md

KEY BENEFITS:
- Faster onboarding: 30-60 min instead of 2-3 hours
- Better focus: Only read what's relevant to your work
- Clear dependencies: Know what blocks you
- Better coordination: Single source of truth for timeline

QUESTIONS?
- See: planning/phases/phase_2/AGENT_NAVIGATION_GUIDE.md
- Ask: In daily standup or coordinator
- Reference: Your role-specific section in AGENT_NAVIGATION_GUIDE.md

The original document is preserved but marked deprecated.
All content is preserved - just reorganized for clarity.
```

## Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:
1. Keep original file in place initially
2. New files can coexist with original during transition
3. If issues found, can revert commit: `git revert [commit]`
4. Original preserved for comparison

No need to worry about breaking anything - the split is additive.

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Team Briefing** (30 min)
   - Share new structure overview
   - Demo how each agent finds their work
   - Answer questions

2. **Soft Rollout** (Days 1-3)
   - Use new docs with current work
   - Gather feedback
   - Fix any issues found

3. **Full Adoption** (Day 4+)
   - Mark original as deprecated
   - Archive original or delete
   - All new work uses split structure

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Update split docs as features complete
   - Add new features to correct category file
   - Archive completed features to completed folder
   - Maintain cross-references as work progresses

## Notes & Tips

### Time Savers
- Use text editor find/replace for consistent formatting
- Copy/paste category sections from original into new files
- Use a template for feature headers to save time
- Have this checklist open while working

### Quality Checks
- Always verify line counts (ctrl+f "^" to count lines)
- Always test links by clicking them
- Always do final spell check before commit
- Always verify git diff before committing

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Don't forget relative path slashes: `[text](../filename.md)`
- Don't create links to files that don't exist yet
- Don't forget to update `completed_features_reference.md` with all 6 features
- Don't forget footer sections in category files
- Don't forget header sections with navigation links

### Questions During Implementation?
Refer back to:
- `SPLIT_PLAN.md` - Why we're splitting
- `SPLIT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - How files should be structured
- `AGENT_NAVIGATION_GUIDE.md` - How agents will use the documents

## Completion

When all checkboxes above are checked:

✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

Next: Team briefing and soft rollout.

**Print this document, check items off as you go, and save it with your commit message for reference.**

**Good luck! The split will make agents much happier with clearer focus.**
