## Getting Started

### 1. Understand the Plan (15 minutes)
```bash
# Read the visual overview
cat PHASE_2_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md

# Then read your specific section
# Find "For [Your Role]" above
```

### 2. Check Your Assignment (5 minutes)

# Find your agent in PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md Section 4 or 11
# Check:
#  - What you're building
#  - How many hours
#  - What you depend on
#  - What depends on you
```

### 3. Start Your Work (Day 1)
```bash
# Follow the detailed checklist in PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
# Use PHASE_2_QUICK_REFERENCE.md for quick lookups
# Check PHASE_2_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md for visual understanding
```

### 4. Weekly Reviews (Every Friday)
```bash
# Review your completion vs checklist
# Report metrics (lines of code, tests, performance)
# Note any blockers
# Validate integration with other components
```

## Communication & Support

### Getting Help
1. **Question about requirements?** → Read relevant section in implementation plan
2. **Blocked on dependency?** → Check "Blocked By" in your task, escalate to context-manager
3. **Technical question?** → Ask in agent-specific section
4. **Performance issue?** → Refer to "Performance Optimization" section
5. **Integration question?** → Check "Integration Points" in execution summary

### Escalation Path
- **<2 hour issue**: Resolve with teammates
- **2-8 hour blocker**: Ping context-manager for unblocking
- **Scope question**: Escalate for Phase 2 freeze decision
- **Architecture question**: Discuss with backend-architect

### Weekly Checkpoint (Every Friday)
- All agents brief status
- Review metrics vs targets
- Identify blockers
- Adjust allocations if needed

## Common Questions

**Q: Where do I start?**
A: Find your role above, read the Quick Reference, then read your detailed section in the Implementation Plan.

**Q: How do I know what to build?**
A: Check your agent assignment in Section 4 or Section 11 of the Implementation Plan. It has a detailed checklist.

**Q: What if I'm blocked?**
A: Check the "Blocked By" section of your task. Escalate to context-manager with details.

**Q: How do I integrate with other components?**
A: Review the Dependency Graph in the Implementation Plan. Test with integration tests.

**Q: What are the success criteria?**
A: Check "Success Criteria" in each section. Also see Quick Reference or Execution Summary.

**Q: Can I start before dependencies are done?**
A: Yes, write interfaces, mocks, and tests. But wait for real components for integration tests.

**Q: What if performance doesn't meet targets?**
A: Profile early (cProfile), benchmark continuously, adjust batch sizes. See troubleshooting section.

**Q: Where are the code examples?**
A: In the Implementation Plan, the Roadmap document (docs/roadmap/v0/phase_02_core_features.md), and agent-specific sections.
