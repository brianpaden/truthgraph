# Phase 2 Handoff Document Splitting Plan

**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Purpose**: Strategy for splitting v0_phase2_completion_handoff.md (2290 lines) into focused handoff files
**Target**: Each file under 700 lines, organized by category and agent role

---

## Executive Summary

The current handoff document contains 2290 lines covering 5 categories, 27 features, and 4 agent roles. Splitting will:
- Enable agents to focus on their specific work without context overhead
- Maintain logical groupings by category and agent responsibility
- Create clear cross-references between files
- Preserve the complete picture through a master index

**Recommended Split**: 7-8 focused files + 1 master index
**Total lines after split**: ~2400 (slightly larger due to cross-reference headers)
**Accessibility**: Agents can reference only files relevant to their role

---

## Cross-Reference Strategy

### Between Files

Each handoff file includes:
1. **Header section** with links to:
   - Master index
   - Related files
   - Executive summary
   - Timeline

2. **Inline cross-references** where:
   - Features mention dependencies
   - Features mention related categories
   - Integration points are highlighted

3. **Footer section** with:
   - Quick links to dependency files
   - Links to related documentation
   - Next steps for coordination

### Example Cross-Reference Structure

```markdown
## Cross-References

**Dependencies**:
- Requires completion of Feature 1.7 from [Dataset Handoff](1_dataset_and_testing_handoff.md)
- Blocks Features 3.1-3.5 from [Validation Handoff](3_validation_framework_handoff.md)

**Related Files**:
- Overall timeline: [Dependencies & Timeline](dependencies_and_timeline.md)
- Success metrics: [Success Criteria](success_criteria_and_risks.md)
- Master index: [Master Handoff](v0_phase2_completion_handoff_MASTER.md)

**Integration Points**:
- Metrics fed to Feature 3.1 (accuracy baseline comparison)
- Results used in Feature 5.4 (optimization recommendations)
```

---

## Completed Features Archival Strategy

### Current Status
Features 1.1-1.6 are marked COMPLETED. These should be:

1. **In Handoff Documents**: Kept in `completed_features_reference.md` for:
   - Quick reference
   - Learning from implementation
   - Understanding existing code

2. **Moved to Completed Folder**: Copy to `planning/features/completed/`
   - Create: `planning/features/completed/1_1_test_claims_dataset_fixture.md`
   - Create: `planning/features/completed/1_2_fever_dataset_integration.md`
   - Create: `planning/features/completed/1_3_real_world_claims_validation.md`
   - Create: `planning/features/completed/1_4_edge_case_corpus.md`
   - Create: `planning/features/completed/1_5_corpus_loading_script.md`
   - Create: `planning/features/completed/1_6_sample_corpus_creation.md`

3. **Create Completion Index**: `planning/features/completed/README.md`
   - Index of all 6 completed features
   - Links to individual completion docs
   - Summary metrics (hours, test coverage, files created)
   - Lessons learned for future phases

### File Naming Convention
- Use kebab-case: `1_1_feature_name.md`
- Include feature number for easy sorting
- Include status badge in header

### What to Include in Completed Feature Files
- Final status report
- Hours spent vs estimated
- Files created and locations
- Test coverage metrics
- Quality metrics (lint, type hints, etc.)
- Lessons learned
- Recommendations for future similar work

---

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Document Preparation (1 hour)
- Create new files structure
- Copy and refactor original content
- Create cross-reference headers

### Phase 2: Content Migration (2-3 hours)
- Split original document
- Add navigation headers
- Update line references
- Create cross-reference links

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (1 hour)
- Verify all links work
- Ensure no content lost
- Validate readability
- Test agent-specific navigation

### Phase 4: Completed Features Archival (1 hour)
- Create completed features folder structure
- Copy 6 completed features with summaries
- Create completion index

### Total Time: ~5-6 hours for complete implementation

---

## Key Benefits of This Split

### For Agents
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Only read 50-100 lines of assigned work
- **Faster onboarding**: 30-60 min instead of 2-3 hours
- **Better focus**: Less distraction from unrelated work
- **Clear success criteria**: Specific to their features
- **Better navigation**: Understand dependencies without reading everything

### For Coordinators
- **Easier tracking**: Check specific handoff file for category status
- **Clear dependencies**: Dedicated dependency file
- **Risk management**: Single file for risks and mitigation
- **Agent accountability**: Individual role definition files

### For Project
- **Sustainability**: Easier to update one category without touching others
- **Reusability**: Template for future phases
- **Archival**: Completed work moves to permanent location
- **Scalability**: Can add more agents/categories without bloat

### For Future Reference
- **Learning**: Completed features archive provides examples
- **Patterns**: Categories show effective document organization
- **Benchmarks**: Success criteria and timelines for similar work
- **Retrospectives**: Files support post-mortems and lessons learned

---

## Technical Considerations

### File Organization
- Use consistent naming: `N_category_handoff.md` where N is 1-5
- Use `handoffs/` subdirectory to keep root clean
- Create `README.md` in `handoffs/` pointing to master

### Cross-Reference Implementation
- Use relative links: `[text](filename.md)` not absolute paths
- Test links work from both root and subdirectory
- Create link validation checklist

### Markdown Standards
- Consistent heading hierarchy (# master, ## categories, ### features)
- Consistent table formatting
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting where appropriate
- Status badges consistent with original document

### Version Control
- Original file: Keep as-is initially (for reference)
- New files: Add to repo with clear commit message
- After verification: Can deprecate original in favor of split version

---

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] All cross-references work correctly
- [ ] Completed features properly archived
- [ ] Team feedback: "Easier to navigate than original"

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate**: Review this plan and get feedback
2. **Approve**: Confirm splitting approach
3. **Implement**: Execute migration per timeline above
4. **Validate**: Test navigation and cross-references
5. **Deploy**: Push to repository and notify team
6. **Monitor**: Track whether split improves agent efficiency

---

## Questions & Clarifications

**Q: Should we keep the original file?**
A: Yes, initially. After verification, you can mark it as deprecated. This helps with transition.

**Q: How do we handle updates?**
A: Update the specific category file + master index. The split structure makes this easier.

**Q: What if features shift between categories?**
A: The split structure makes reordering easier. Just move features between files and update dependencies.

**Q: Can agents still see the full picture?**
A: Yes, via master index, timeline, and completed features reference. Each agent can also read 2-3 related handoffs for context.

**End of Splitting Plan**

This plan provides a complete roadmap for reorganizing the handoff document into a more agent-friendly structure while maintaining project coherence. Ready to implement upon approval.
