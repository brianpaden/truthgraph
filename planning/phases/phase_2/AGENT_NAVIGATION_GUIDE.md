### Escalation Checklist

When to escalate:
- [ ] Performance targets not being met by Feature 2.1/2.2/2.3
- [ ] Accuracy below 70% in Feature 3.1
- [ ] Feature 1.7 baseline delayed (blocks everything)
- [ ] Agent requests more time than allocated
- [ ] Multiple tests failing in any category
- [ ] Quality gates at risk (coverage, linting, type hints)

## Tips for Agents

### For Faster Onboarding
1. Start with `v0_phase2_quick_start.md` (really, it takes 5 min)
2. Jump to your primary file immediately
3. Skim cross-references, don't read thoroughly unless needed
4. Ask clarifying questions in standup

### For Staying Oriented
1. Bookmark `handoffs/dependencies_and_timeline.md` (check it daily)
2. Keep your primary handoff open while working
3. Check `success_criteria_and_risks.md` if hitting blockers
4. Reference completed features for patterns (5.x features especially)

### For Coordination
1. Update progress daily in standup
2. Flag blockers immediately (don't wait)
3. Read cross-referenced files before asking coordinators
4. Use this navigation guide to self-serve documentation

### For Documentation
1. Link to handoffs in your commits
2. Reference specific feature sections
3. Keep cross-references updated
4. Update completion dates as you finish
