# üß™ Experimental Feature: Bayesian Confidence Modeling

**Status:** Experimental (under evaluation for inclusion in TruthGraph v0.3)
**Author:** TruthGraph Research Team
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22

## 1. Overview

This experimental module introduces **Bayesian confidence estimation** for fact-checking pipelines.
Instead of using raw softmax probabilities, the system treats veracity and evidence reliability as **random variables** with prior distributions, enabling principled uncertainty propagation through the reasoning graph.

Goal:

> ‚ÄúQuantify what the model *believes* about a fact and *how certain* it is, not just whether it‚Äôs labeled ‚Äòtrue.‚Äô‚Äù

---

## 2. Motivation

Modern fact-checking datasets (FEVER, SciFact, KILT) rely on discrete labels and heuristic confidence scores.
However, automated verifiers must reason over noisy evidence, incomplete sources, and model uncertainty.

Bayesian methods address this by:

* Providing **posterior belief distributions** instead of point estimates
* Supporting **uncertainty calibration and abstention** (credible intervals)
* Allowing **belief propagation** across reasoning chains
* Facilitating **multi-source reliability weighting** (truth discovery)

---

## 3. Bayesian Modeling Framework

Each claim ( C ) has a latent binary variable ( T_C \in {0,1} ) representing truth.

Given evidence ( E = {e_1, e_2, ‚Ä¶, e_n} ):

[
P(T_C | E) \propto P(T_C) \prod_i P(e_i | T_C)^{w_i}
]

where ( w_i ) is the reliability weight of each evidence source.

### 3.1 Layers of Uncertainty

| Layer              | Variable | Example Distribution    | Description                                  |
| ------------------ | -------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Retrieval          | ( R_i )  | Beta(Œ±, Œ≤)              | Confidence that evidence ( e_i ) is relevant |
| Verification       | ( V_i )  | Bernoulli(p) / Gaussian | Probability claim entails evidence           |
| Reasoning          | ( T_C )  | Bernoulli(posterior)    | Final veracity belief                        |
| Source reliability | ( S_j )  | Beta                    | Learned trust level per source               |

Each layer updates priors to posteriors using **Bayesian updating** or **variational inference**.

---

### 3.2 Belief Propagation Across Graphs

For chained reasoning:
[
P(T_C) = 1 - \prod_i (1 - P(T_{E_i}))
]
or, using weighted logic inference:
[
P(T_C) = \sigma\left( \sum_i w_i \cdot \text{truth}(E_i) \right)
]

Implemented via **Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL)** or **Markov Logic Networks (MLNs)**.

## 4. Integration with TruthGraph Schema

```json
"belief": {
  "prior": 0.5,
  "posterior": {
    "mean": 0.82,
    "variance": 0.07,
    "credible_interval": [0.68, 0.93]
  },
  "method": "BayesianEvidenceAggregation",
  "calibrated": true,
  "sources": [
    {"doc_id": "wiki:Eiffel_Tower", "likelihood": 0.9, "reliability": 0.95},
    {"doc_id": "britannica:Big_Ben", "likelihood": 0.85, "reliability": 0.9}
  ]
}
```

Each claim node stores **priors, posteriors, and credible intervals** in the Provenance Graph:

```provenance
:Claim123 prov:wasDerivedFrom :Evidence456 ;
           tg:prior 0.6 ;
           tg:posterior 0.9 ;
           tg:variance 0.04 .
```

## 5. Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Bayesian Calibration

* Add MC-Dropout or Deep Ensembles to NLI verifiers
* Compute posterior predictive variance
* Calibrate using Brier and ECE scores

### Phase 2: Evidence Aggregation

* Model multi-evidence updates using weighted likelihoods
* Maintain per-source reliability priors
* Store posterior confidence in Neo4j/RDF nodes

### Phase 3: Graph Propagation

* Integrate PSL or PyMC graph layer
* Propagate uncertainty through multi-hop chains
* Visualize belief intervals in the UI

### Phase 4: Evaluation

* Metrics: NLL, Brier Score, ECE, Coverage-Accuracy, FEVER-U score
* Compare deterministic vs. Bayesian calibration accuracy
