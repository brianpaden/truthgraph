### 1.4 Performance Intelligence

**Embedding Service Current Performance**:

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Status |

## PART 4: RISKS & MITIGATION STRATEGY

### 4.1 Known Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Profiling overhead skews results | Medium | Medium | Use sampling profiling, compare with/without |
| Results vary between runs | Low | Medium | Multiple iterations, report statistics (P50/P95) |
| Memory profiling adds complexity | Low | Medium | Optional detailed mode, document overhead |
| Batch size > 256 causes OOM | Low | Low | Test incrementally, catch exceptions |
| GPU/CPU results differ significantly | Medium | High | Profile on CPU (primary), note GPU separately |

**Risk Response Plan**:
1. **Sampling-based Profiling**: Use statistical profiling instead of full tracing
2. **Multiple Runs**: Run each test 2-3 times, report averages
3. **Incremental Testing**: Test batch sizes incrementally, stop if OOM
4. **Platform Awareness**: Document which platform (CPU/GPU/MPS) results from
5. **Baseline Comparison**: Validate methodology matches Feature 1.7

### 4.2 Dependency Risks

**All Dependencies Met**:
âœ“ Feature 1.7 complete (baseline available)
âœ“ EmbeddingService stable (no changes expected)
âœ“ Test data available (fixtures ready)
âœ“ Tools installed (cProfile, psutil, torch)

**No Feature Dependency Risks** - Can proceed independently

### 4.3 Quality Risks

**Code Quality Targets**:
- Type hints: 100%
- Docstrings: 100%
- Test coverage: 80%+
- Lint score: 10/10

**Validation**:
- Mypy type checking
- Ruff linting
- Pytest for tests
- Manual review before commit

---

## PART 8: KEY DECISIONS & RATIONALE

### 8.1 Why This Approach

**Decision 1: Create New Scripts in `scripts/profile/`**
- Rationale: Keep benchmark scripts (Feature 1.7) separate from profiling scripts
- Benefit: Cleaner organization, easier to find tools
- Alternative: Extend benchmark_embeddings.py (not chosen - better separation)

**Decision 2: Profile Batch Sizes 8-256**
- Rationale: Current optimal is 64, range covers practical scenarios
- Benefit: Comprehensive but not excessive testing
- Alternative: Test 1-1024 (too many, same information)

**Decision 3: Use cProfile for CPU Analysis**
- Rationale: Built-in, no dependencies, excellent call graph
- Benefit: Production-ready, no external tools needed
- Alternative: memory_profiler alone (incomplete - misses CPU)

**Decision 4: Test Text Lengths 10-1024 Characters**
- Rationale: Covers real-world range (short to document-length)
- Benefit: Identify impact of text preprocessing
- Alternative: Fixed text length (misses important variable)

**Decision 5: Validate Against Feature 1.7 Baseline**
- Rationale: Ensure consistency and catch regressions
- Benefit: Confidence in methodology, continuity
- Alternative: Skip validation (risky - could miss issues)

### 8.2 What We're NOT Doing

**Not Implementing Optimizations** - Only profiling and recommending
- Feature 2.4 will implement based on findings
- Keeps scope clear (8 hours for profiling, not optimization)
- Better separation of concerns

**Not Using GPU-Specific Tools** - CPU focus
- Primary deployment is CPU-based
- GPU results noted separately if available
- Avoids complexity of GPU profiling

**Not Changing EmbeddingService** - Profiling only
- Service is already production-ready
- Changes come after analysis (Feature 2.4)
- Enables clean rollback if needed

**Not Rewriting Benchmark Scripts** - Reference and extend
- Feature 1.7 benchmarks are proven
- Profiling scripts are complementary
- Cleaner than merging code
