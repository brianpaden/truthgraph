## How Documents Support Different Phases

### Phase 1 (Complete) - Not Covered
These docs focus on Phase 2. For Phase 1 info, see:
- `docs/roadmap/v0/phase_01_foundation.md`
- `docs/roadmap/v0/fastapi_implementation.md`

### Phase 2 (In Planning) - Covered Comprehensively
All 5 documents focus on Phase 2:
1. Feature breakdown (12 features)
2. Agent assignments (6-8 agents)
3. Timeline (2 weeks)
4. Success criteria
5. Execution details

### Phase 3+ (Future) - Notes Only
These docs mention Phase 3 readiness but don't plan it:
- See `PHASE_2_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md` "Phase 3 Preparation"
- See `PHASE_2_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Section 9 "Post-Phase 2"
