## Usage Examples

### Basic Test with Fixture
```python
def test_claim_verification(claim_by_id):
    claim = claim_by_id("test_001")
    assert claim["expected_verdict"] == "SUPPORTED"
```

### Test with Verdict Filtering
```python
def test_all_supported_claims(claims_by_verdict):
    supported = claims_by_verdict("SUPPORTED")
    assert len(supported) == 15
```

### Test with Category Filtering
```python
def test_science_claims(claims_by_category):
    science = claims_by_category("science")
    assert len(science) == 8
```

### Test Edge Cases
```python
def test_edge_cases(claims_by_edge_case):
    insufficient = claims_by_edge_case("insufficient_evidence")
```
