# Documentation Reorganization Archive

This directory contains the planning and execution documentation for the TruthGraph documentation reorganization completed on 2025-10-26.

## What Happened

The TruthGraph repository had 33+ markdown files at the root level, making it difficult to find documentation. We reorganized into a three-tier structure:

- **docs/** - Permanent documentation (guides, architecture, API, services)
- **planning/** - Active planning (features, phases, technical debt)
- **archive/** - Historical documentation (completed features, implementation summaries)

## Files in This Archive

- [DOCUMENTATION_REORG_INDEX.md](./DOCUMENTATION_REORG_INDEX.md) - Master index and navigation
- [DOCUMENTATION_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md](./DOCUMENTATION_REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md) - Executive summary
- [DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md](./DOCUMENTATION_ORGANIZATION_GUIDE.md) - Comprehensive 8,000-word guide
- [DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE_VISUAL.md](./DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE_VISUAL.md) - Visual diagrams
- [DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_PLAN.md](./DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_PLAN.md) - Step-by-step migration guide

## Results

**Before:**
- 33+ markdown files at root
- Difficult to navigate
- No clear organization

**After:**
- Only README.md at root
- Clear three-tier structure
- Easy navigation with README indexes
- Documentation cheat sheet at [docs/guides/documentation-cheat-sheet.md](../../docs/guides/documentation-cheat-sheet.md)

## Migration Statistics

- **Files Moved:** 60+ documentation files
- **New Directories:** 20+ organized directories
- **README Indexes Created:** 3 main indexes
- **Broken Links Fixed:** All internal links updated
- **Time Taken:** ~2 hours

## Future Maintenance

The reorganization established clear patterns for where new documentation belongs:

- New guides → `docs/guides/`
- New features → `planning/features/in_progress/`
- Completed work → `archive/completed_features/`
- Architecture decisions → `docs/architecture/decisions/`

See [docs/guides/documentation-cheat-sheet.md](../../docs/guides/documentation-cheat-sheet.md) for daily reference.
