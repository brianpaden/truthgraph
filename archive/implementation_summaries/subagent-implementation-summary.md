2. **Performance Not Meeting <60s Target** (Medium probability, high impact)
   - Mitigation: Continuous profiling, batch size tuning, GPU support

3. **pgvector Index Performance** (Medium probability, medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Benchmark early with 10k+, tune IVFFlat parameters

4. **Accuracy Below 70%** (Low-medium probability, high impact)
   - Mitigation: Validate NLI with fixtures, tune thresholds, fallback strategy

5. **Memory Exceeding 4GB** (Low probability, medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Profile early, test on 4GB machine, quantization option

### Resource Risks

1. **Agent Unavailability** (Medium probability)
   - Mitigation: Cross-training, clear documentation, checkpoint handoff

2. **Scope Creep** (High probability, medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Feature freeze, out-of-scope list for Phase 3, checkpoint reviews

### Integration Risks

1. **API Integration Complexity** (Low probability, medium impact)
   - Mitigation: Early contract definition, mock API, integration tests

2. **Database Schema Issues** (Low probability, high impact)
   - Mitigation: Test on full backup, backward compatibility, staging validation
